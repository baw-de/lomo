# LoMo

**LoMo** is an open source tool for analyzing lock filling processes. It uses an 
one-dimensional shallow water model to simulate the wave propagation in the lock
chamber. Beside the filling time, the forces acting on the ship in longitudinal
direction are computed. 


## System requirements

* [Java Runtime Environment 8](https://java.com) 
* Java SE Development Kit 8 (optional)
* Apache Maven 3.3+ (optional)


## Installation

**LoMo** can be run using our [release binaries](https://github.com/baw-de/lomo/releases) or building it from source 
using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

```
git checkout -t <TAG>
mvn clean package
```


## Development

**LoMo** is developed at the [Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute](http://www.baw.de/).
It is based on an object-oriented software design to allow simple extension of 
the software. 

**LoMo** is written in the Java programming language. Developing **LoMo** using 
the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/) should work well.

You are welcome to submit issues or pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/baw-de/lomo/) 
to support the development of **LoMo**.
